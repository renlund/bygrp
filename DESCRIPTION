Title: Fast But Stupid Grouped Statistics
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R:
    person("Henrik", "Renlund", email = "henrikrenlund@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Fast ways of calculating some common statistics under a grouping. Non-sophisticated (or stupid) in that any expression given to these functions will not themselves be evaluated under the grouping. Thus, not a general tool but perhaps useful in certain curcumstances. Always relies on data already being sufficiently ordered.
