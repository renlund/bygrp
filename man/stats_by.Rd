\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector.}

\item{grp}{A grouping vector within values of which the statistic is to be
calculated. Should not contain missing values.}

\item{na.rm}{A logical value; remove missing values}

\item{NAopt}{A logical value; if missing values are removed, should the
result still be NA for the cases where x is completely missing?}

\item{noNA}{A logical value; in some cases x cannot contain missing values,
then this parameter can be set to TRUE to gain some speed.}
}
\description{
\code{X_by} are functions to calculate the statistic X under a grouping
variable specified by grp. Important: x and grp are assumed to be ordered on
grp such that equal values appear consecutively, and there should be no
missing values in grp.
}
\details{
sum_by does summation.

max_by calculates the maximum.

min_by calculates the minimum.

duplicated_by looks for duplicated values. If
\code{na.rm = TRUE}, then missing values are never considered
duplicates.

n_by calculates number of rows. If \code{na.rm = TRUE} it will not
count rows where x is missing.

duplicated_by looks for duplicated values. If
\code{na.rm = TRUE}, then missing values are never considered
duplicates.

anyTRUE_by checks for any TRUE value. Note that NAs
will count as FALSE.

lag1_by is lag by 1.

lead1_by is lead by 1.
